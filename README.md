# React Native ISBN Scanner

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier. We can find it on the back cover of a book. An EAN-13 barcode is usually printed to be read by machines.

This React Native demo can scan ISBN barcodes using [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) and get its info using the Google Book API.
